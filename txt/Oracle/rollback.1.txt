For equally sized rollback segments, OPTIMAL should be slightly larger
than the average size.

Shrinks  Average  Analysis and recommendations

-------  -------  -----------------------------------------------------
Low      Low      If average sizes active is close to Sizes,Optimal
.                 then the OPTIMAL setting is correct.Otherwise Optimal
.                 is too large.
Low      High     Excellent - A good setting for OPTIMAL
High     Low      OPTIMAL is too small - too many shrinks are being
.                 performed
High     High     Periodic long transcationsare probably causing these
.                 statistics.Set the OPTIMAL parameter higher until
.                 Shrinks is lower.
