Notes:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.    Not all waits are shown.

2.    Buffer busy waits may be caused by free list contention
.     for specific tables (create more free lists if neccesary)
.     or by insufficient rollback segments or extents

3.    Free buffer waits may be caused by excessive disk sorts

4.    Enqueue waits may indicate contention for table or row
.     locks (do you have foreign keys defined without indexes?)

5.    Examine v$latch (or run latch_sta.sql) if latch waits are 
.     significant

6.    Excessive log file write or sync waits may be caused by a
.     high value for LOG_BUFFER
