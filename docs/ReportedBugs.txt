ReportedBugs

This file contains reported bugs, to be fixed when someone has time.  Anyone
who wants may chase any of these and submit patches to the orac-dev list; they
will be greatly appreciated.

* This is probably a minor thing, but I've noticed that if you don't quit
  nicely, the config/what_db.txt doesn't get updated correctly.  That is,
  it's not getting written as soon as a valid connection is made.  I've
  found that I can correctly connect, then ^C in my xterm, and the file
  will have the original (& wrong) value. [Reported by KevinB, do we need
  a SIG handler?]
* Autoclear does not seem to work on callbacks like:
  sub onstat_chunks
  {
     my $self = shift;
     $self->f_clr();
     $self->show_sql("Chunks", "1");
  }
  [Reported by KevinB, may affect only him?]
* The main window is fine, but the dialog box for errors, the show_sql
  dialog box, and the GUI shell window all have scrolled text frames
  that will expand horizontally, but if I resize them vertically, the
  scrolled text frames do not increase in size, but the area of the
  window at the bottom (below the OK button in the dialog boxes) grows.
  [Reported by BruceA]
* However, I noticed today that the 
  Oracle show SQL pool/Explain Plain window doesn't grow when resized.
