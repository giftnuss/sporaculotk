ToDo

This is the Orac Master ToDo list.  It contains items that have been suggested
and are under serious consideration by one or more developers.  However, there
are no promises that any of these will ever get done. :-)

This table has 4 columns:  Suggester (who suggested it), Date (the date of the
email to the orac-dev list), Developer (who has agreed to work on the task to
make it happen), Task (a description of the item).

Suggester  Date    Developer    Task
=========  ======  =========    =============================================
KevinB     990714               Add graphing of DB stats.  (There may be
                                problems with GD & GIFGRAPH, consider
                                alternatives.)
all        990722  KevinK       A CM system w/ remote ability (CVS?)
KevinB     990729               Add a Makefile, to handle "install", creation
                                of man pages, etc.  It MUST be very simple
                                to use.
AndyD      990823               Create online functionality, such as graphs
                                which continuously monitor a database for you
                                in, say, a little graphed window which you can
                                leave at the top of a screen.
KevinB     990830               Can we get resize handles on all windows?
BruceA     990831               Mysql support
BruceA     990831               Postgresql support
BruceA     990831               DBD::ODBC + DBD::Proxy support of existing
                                database type
BruceA     990831               Document orac_dba.pl
KevinB     990903               Document orac_Base variable/flags,
                                e.g. dont_need_ps, etc.
BruceA     990921               Add an input for refresh interval to
                                live_update()


Then we have the wish list.  These are also things we'd like done, but aren't
nearly as important functionally.

=========  ======  =========    =============================================
KevinK     990625               A call hierarchy (function & callback,
                                cflow-like info)
AndyD      990707               Language selectable online, at start-up
                                (change GUI)
KevinB     990710               Add Help button in menubar, add "About" &
                                "Tutorial", "ReadMe", etc.
KevinB     990812               Add an "Options/Preferences" dialog under
                                "File", it would handle:  language, colors,
                                fonts, Look&Feel, ... [Use Storable module?]
KevinB     990816               Consider adding a "Print" feature (just ASCII).
KevinB     990903               Consider rewriting orac_dba.pl to match new
                                style.
TomL       990920               Something to consider with the monitoring 
                                tools is we may need a client/server style 
                                mode.  The monitors run on the server and 
                                are stored in some form (dbm, csv, dbms <<- 
                                my vote).  Also, lets consider an "export" 
                                and "import" of these stats to a history 
                                container.  Lastly, consider the
                                presentation of the information.  Do we 
                                present IO as a funnel with data
                                flowing through it, or just numbers?
                                Database bench mark is also good.  You know 
                                the day you leave the users always call to 
                                complain everything is running slow.
