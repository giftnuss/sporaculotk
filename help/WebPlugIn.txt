WebPlugIn

OracWeb
=======
It is now possible (albeit a bit tricky) to run Orac over the web.
You will require the use of Frank Holtry's Perl/Tk Plug-In, pplug,
which you can find here:

=> http://home.rmi.net/~fholtry/

Setting Up the Perl/Tk Plug-In
==============================
Setting this up is currently a non-automatic process.  Please 
follow the set-up of the Plug-In, with Frank's instructions,
as closely as you can.  It can become involved, and may not work
under all OSes, but is worth the experimentation :-)

Hopefully, once you've got it all working, you can now move onto
our instructions.  We've tried this using Linux/Apache/Netscape
and Solaris/Apache/Netscape combinations for Oracle.  You may
like to experiment with your own OS/Webserver/Database
combinations.

You may like to follow Frank's pages and email listings for 
further information on this (b)leading edge technology.  

It's a lot of fun :-)

Oracle Set-up: OracWeb for the Pplug NetScape Plug-In
=====================================================

*. This section assumes you fully understand the set-up of
   Frank's plug-in, and have completed the installation. It also
   assumes your Webserver is Apache, for ease of description,
   and that you're familiar with configuring Apache.
*. First, unpack your Orac distribution file under your
   Apache cgi-bin directory.
*. Rename Orac-x.y.z/orac_dba.pl to Orac-x.y.z/orac_dba.ppl
*. Go to Orac-x.y.z/pplug directory
*. Edit the orac.html file by renaming the Orac-x.y.z string
   to the appropriate directory under cgi-bin.
*. Move orac.html to your Apache /htdocs directory.
*. Edit the perlplus-secure.cgi file.  Edit the URL_ROOT string
   to your appropriate host, the one you compile the Frank 
   Holtry Plug-in with, using the Makefile SECURE_CGI
   directive.
*. Move perlplus-secure.cgi directly into the Apache cgi-bin.
*. Now copy Orac-x.y.z/img/splash.gif to your Apache /icons
   directory.  It will be accessed here by orac.html later.
*. Under your Apache configuration file, httpd.conf, and 
   add the following section (adapt where appropriate):

   # OracWeb General Environment Variables
   SetEnv ORACWEB_SWITCH 1
   
   SetEnv ORACWEB_DB_TYPE Oracle
   
   SetEnv ORACWEB_DBA_USER SYSTEM
   SetEnv ORACWEB_BACKGROUND_COL steelblue2
   SetEnv ORACWEB_STANDARD_DB pppep
   SetEnv ORACWEB_FOREGROUND_COL black
   SetEnv ORACWEB_ENTRY_COL white
   
   SetEnv ORACWEB_FONT_FAMILY courier
   SetEnv ORACWEB_FONT_SIZE 10
   SetEnv ORACWEB_FONT_WEIGHT normal
   SetEnv ORACWEB_FONT_SLANT roman
   
   # OracWeb Specific Oracle Required Variable
   SetEnv ORACLE_HOME /u00/app/oracle/8.0.4

*. Shutdown your Apache httpd program, and restart with new
   configurations.

Unfortunately, your OracWeb program will probably *NOT* 
come up as if by magic, over your netscape connection, 
(though it might).

It'll probably take a lot more work to get the whole thing
going, but once you've done it, it'll probably be worth it.
Also, if you would like to become the OracWeb Plug-In Guru,
the vacancy is there.  The salary's not up to much, but
the hours are great.

Good luck! :-)
