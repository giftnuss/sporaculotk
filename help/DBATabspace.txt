Oracle has two versions of a tablespace map.
The early 1.x version of OEM had a separate tool bundled with the Tuning
pack extension for OEM.
It was a fine tool. Three panels. On the left side full height we had a tree
listing the tablespaces. Open one and it would display the separate
datafiles. Select either the tablespace or a datafile and it would open two
panels on the right 2/3 of the window. The top half was divided into two
parts. On the left was a summary of the currently selected segment and
extent. It listed the size, in blocks, of the extent and the segment. On the
right of that summary was a list of segments with segment type, number of
extents and size. Below, in the lower right quandrant was a graphic display.
The graphic used three colors. Each extent had a fine black line border. One
color for unallocated space, one for the currently selected segment and all
its extents, and a third for allocated, but not selected space. The extents
were rectangles arranged in horizontal stripes. The extent rectangles were
scaled to fit the window. As a result a busy tablespace might have so little
space for each extent that the extents ran together to create a mass of
black border stripes. The new version of the tablespace map, now
incorporated with the storage manager,  scrolls but I think the scale is
fixed. That makes it difficult to see the big picture. Not sure which I
prefer.

I may be able to install the old version to get you a screen shot of the
earlier tablespace manager. I'll have to remove all of Oracle from my PC to
install the old version. It's from single NT ORACLE_HOME days and won't
install if you have a later installation already on the machine. I'm
planning to remove and reinstall over the next couple of days. I'll get you
a picture to work from.

By the way, one handy feature would be a display of the blocksize, or a way
to display size either in blocks or K or Meg.

Here's a shot of the current version of the tablespace map. This is from a
system tablespace from before I learned you have to edit sql.bsq to set
space allocation before creating the database.




I should be able to get you a screen shot of the better earlier tool later
this week.

By the way, I was very excited to see the pre-announcement of your Oracle
and Open Source book. I'll be sure to buy it as soon as it's out.

Can't wait to see all this in Orac! :-)

Do you mean by structure, something where you see a tablespace, then all the
bits and pieces that make it up?  I'll try and think of some SQL today that
will do that, and run it by you both?
