THINGS I DONT LIKE
------------------
The segment stored procedures are awful.  If segments overlap on
devices, I have not figured out a good way  to decode the free space 
available on that segment.  You thus can run out of space and I dont know
of a good way of detecting it in advance.  I may try to code up some 
procedures that work ASSUMING you have one segment per device or some other 
such limitations.  

Three of the stored procedures use syscomments.  To make output reasonable,
I only use row 1.  In a wierd cases (ie. in sp__helpview) where the select
statement of a view (the part before the where) is over 255 characters, this
procedure will produce incorrect output.  Concievable but extremely rare.

OUTSTANDING BUGS
