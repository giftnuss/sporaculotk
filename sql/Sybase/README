EXTENDED SYBASE STORED PROCEDURES V3.0
Copyright (c) 1995-7 By Edward Barlow
======================================


Enclosed is a FREE set of Sybase stored procedures that extend the Sybase
provided procedures. These procedures provide additional functionality and 
provide new ways to look at the data provided by Sybase in their System Tables.
They also provide many new formats that allows users, developers, and 
administrators to see the data they want in the format they want.  I think 
the procedures are a MUST for managing your sybase environment.

This version has been tested under 4.8, 4.9, and System 10. The procedures
are free of all known bugs.

All procedure names start with "sp__". This naming convention ensures that 
the procedures, when run, will be available from any database and that, 
when they are run, the database context will be the current database. 
Thus, if you are in the statsdb database, you can get the space used in 
statsdb by running sp__dbspace.

I am interested in any thoughts about how to expand these procedures.  
Please send me any comments and suggestions (see below for address).

Full documentation is included in the file man.doc.  This is a microsoft word
for windows 6.0 document.  There is also a file man.txt which is the 
documentation in text format (which might be hard to read due to line breaks).

EXTRACTION OF FILES
===================

If you received a tar file:
--------------------------------
The library is released as tar file.  untar that file to create the 
subdirectory procs and follow instructions in the readme file (this file).  
See the sample script at the end of this section.

	# the next command extracts into a directory called procs
	tar xvf proc200.tar
	cd procs
	# optionally edit the files database and dumpdb if system 10
	# the next command installs on servers
	configure

If you recieved a zip file:
---------------------------
unzip the file.  There IS NO AUTO CONFIGURATION UTILITY FOR DOS.  Sorry.
If someone who knows dos shell would write one, it would be greatly
appreciated, but i dont have the foggiest idea how (i would need a command
line isql...).  

INSTALATION OF PROCEDURES
=========================
These procedures reside in the master database (in Sybase 4.9.2) or 
in the sybsystemprocs database of system 10.  To install these procedures, 
run the command configure. As the master or sybsystemprocs database will be 
modified by these procedures, it is suggested that you dump that database 
before you load the procedures. The script for each procedure will issue 
a "dump tran $database with truncate_only" prior to the addition of 
the procedure so that log space (which is generally small) will not 
be filled.  

USAGE, RESALE AND COPYRIGHT
===========================
I am releasing this library as freeware.  I ask that you try the software and
register when you install (the configure utility prompts you to send me an 
email).  Redistribute the package at will (see below).  Tell your friends.
Give me access to procedures that you have written for future versions.  Tell 
me about bugs.  Be nice - I am making no money off this.

You are allowed to use this software so long as all copyright 
notices and the README file are not altered and so long as no money is made 
by the sale of this software (i.e. you cant include it in a commercial 
package without permission). If you would like to "make money" or include 
the code in a commercial package, I ask that you decide on a "fair" price 
and create some form of "fair" agreeement. Make two copies, sign them both, 
and send them to the author (Edward Barlow). If the agreement seems fair, 
I will sign both and send one copy back to you, and we will have a deal.  
I have put significant effort into this code and, while my primary purpose 
is to create software for people to use, I expect a fair shake from anybody 
who can profit from my endeavors. 

UNINSTALL
=========
SQL statements to uninstall this package are contained in the file cleanup.SQL.
If running on System 10 the dumpdb and database files should be modified as
mentioned above.

WARANTY
=======
This software is provided as-is. No warranties or guarantees 
are made. To the best of my knowledge, any bugs or outstanding issues 
are documented in the file "BUGS" that comes with the source code. 
Please notify me of any things that can be done to make this a better package.  

ONE CHEAP PLUG
==============
I do unix & sybase consulting work in the New York Area.  Get in touch if 
you think I might be of assistance.  I have developed some nice commercial
software that can be used for Sybase security and performance audits and
am able to personally perform these for a reasonable price.  I also have
a really nice package that can automate system administration (real time
system monitoring, multi server id administration, historical reports, 
application performance audits, configuration reporting, and nightly sybase 
scheduling). My phone is (212) 366-1137.  My email is sqltech@tiac.net.

FINAL NOTE
==========
All procedures in this package are copyright (c) 1994-6 by Edward Barlow
and / or Simon Walker of the SQL Workshop Ltd.  A few of the procedures are
copyright by other authors (documented), and all procedures are distributed
here with permission.  Special thanks to Desiree Johnson for her help.
