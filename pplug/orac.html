<h1>Orac - Database Administration</h1>
The open source Perl/Tk Database Administration tool for GNU world DBAs 
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Orac is an open source database administration tool written in perl/Tk. It was written primarily by and for DBAs. However, it will also be very useful to developers and anyone else that wants to understand more about how (and how well) their database is working.
<p>
Orac is muli-platform and multi-database aware. Currently, it is known to work on Solaris, Linux and Windows NT but it should work on any platform that supports perl 5.005 and Tk 8.0015. Database support is currently included for Oracle, Sybase and Informix. The Orac team would very much like to support an open source database such as mSQL or PostGres and is acitvely soliciting for volunteers for this task.
